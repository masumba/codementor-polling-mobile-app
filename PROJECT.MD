# Introduction
You will create a mobile application using your preferred technology. Users can authenticate, upload photos from their phone, view other peoples' photos, and vote on each photo. The estimated time for this project is around 25 hours.

# Requirements
* Ask users to authenticate before using the application
* Select photos from local phone storage
* The user can add a description to the photo selected
* The user can save the images into firebase cloud storage
* The user can view all the images, including other users' images
* The user can click on specific image and be able to vote on the image
* The user can view the votes, caste in percentage
* The user should not be able to vote more than once on a specific photo

## For an extra challenge
* Create a PagerAdapter such that a user can swipe left or right while viewing photos
* Double tap when liking the photo

# Suggested Implementation
* To learn iOS development, implement the app using [Swift](https://swift.org/).
* To learn Android development, implement using Java on the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio).
* To learn how to build multi-platform apps, use [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
