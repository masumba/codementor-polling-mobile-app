# Introduction
You will create a mobile application using your preferred technology. Users can authenticate, upload photos from their phone, view other peoples' photos, and vote on each photo. The estimated time for this project is around 25 hours.

# Requirements

Select photos from local phone storage
The user can add a description to the photo selected
The user can save the images into firebase cloud storage
The user can view all the images, including other users' images
The user can click on specific image and be able to vote on the image
The user can view the votes, caste in percentage
The user should not be able to vote more than once on a specific photo
## For an extra challenge

Create a PagerAdapter such that a user can swipe left or right while viewing photos
Double tap when liking the photo
# Suggested Implementation
